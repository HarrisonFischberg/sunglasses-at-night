# Activity log

## 2026-10-17 — scaffold

- Created project skeleton under the `new-app` skill.
- Next: Phase 0 intake and tool-environment verification.

## 2026-10-18 — Phase 0–3 (plan only, no product code)

- Intake answered by owner: name Sunglasses at Night, macOS+iOS/iPadOS, refs Noir / Dark Reader / Midnight, private repo, free, global, hello@rarecreatures.app, youngest age.
- Tools: `docs/tool-environment.md` (Caveman BLOCKED, REA web capture BLOCKED: no CDP browser).
- Discovery: public listings only → `docs/rea-findings.md`, `replica/`.
- Wrote prd.md DRAFT v1, data inventory, checklist (pre-build), blockers B1–B12.
- Ralph runner adapted at `ralph/ralph.sh`; refuses to run until prd.md says APPROVED.
- Next: owner approval of prd.md + permission changes.

## 2026-10-17: T001 color engine (Ralph iteration). BLOCKED (B13)

- Goal: T001 acceptance criteria (≥40 unit cases incl. edge syntaxes; WCAG contrast ±0.01), proven by `node --test engine/test/`.
- Wrote:
  - `engine/src/color.js` (ESM). Parses hex, the 148 named colors, transparent, currentcolor (via `opts.currentColor`), rgb/rgba, hsl/hsla (legacy + modern syntax), hwb, lab, lch, oklab, oklch, and color() in srgb, srgb-linear, display-p3, a98-rgb, prophoto-rgb, rec2020, and xyz/xyz-d50/xyz-d65. Also handles `none`, angle units, calc(), relative color syntax (`from`), light-dark(), and color-mix() with hue methods, premultiplied alpha and missing components. A var(), system-color or unresolvable operand returns `opts.fallback`. Also does sRGB↔OKLCH, CSS Color 4 gamut mapping, WCAG relative luminance + contrast with alpha compositing, and formatRgb/formatHex.
  - `engine/test/color.test.js`: 62 `test()` cases (52 + 10 WCAG reference rows).
  - `engine/scripts/check.js` for `npm run check`.
- Verification: **not run.** `node --test engine/test/` → "This command requires approval". The same refusal came for `npm test`, `node engine/scripts/check.js` and `rtk proxy node --test engine/test/`, despite the allow rules in `.claude/settings.json`. Logged as B13. Zero verification runs completed, so the 5-attempt budget is untouched. Nothing is claimed passing.
- Note for T020 sweep: the CSS named color `midnightblue` in `color.js` is a standard keyword, not reference branding. Expect a false positive on "Midnight".
- Note for T007: the engine is ESM. Content scripts will need a dynamic `import(runtime.getURL(...))` or a build step.
- Next: owner fixes B13 (allowlist vs RTK rewrite), then rerun `node --test engine/test/` and set T001 done or fix failures.
